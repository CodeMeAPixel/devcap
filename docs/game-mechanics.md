# Game Mechanics

Developer Capitalist simulates the journey of a software developer growing their coding empire through various game mechanics:

## Core Mechanics

## Team Members

Team members enhance your production capabilities:
- Each team member provides a production bonus
- Team members have specializations that affect different aspects of your empire
- The cost of hiring increases with each team member

## Upgrades

Upgrades provide permanent boosts to your production:
- Click upgrades increase your manual LoC generation
- Business upgrades increase the efficiency of specific or all businesses
- Team upgrades enhance the productivity of your team members
- Global upgrades affect multiple aspects of the game

## Achievements

Achievements are special milestones that provide rewards:
- Unlock by reaching specific targets (e.g., X lines of code written)
- Earn one-time LoC bonuses
- Showcase your progress and accomplishments
