## About the Project

Developer Capitalist was born from a simple question: What if Adventure Capitalist met the world of software development? As developers, we spend countless hours writing code, building projects, and growing our skills. This game aims to capture that journey in a fun, simplified, and slightly exaggerated way.

The inspiration came during a late-night coding session when I realized that the progression in development careers - from writing your first lines of code to potentially running a tech empire - has similarities to the incremental growth mechanics of idle games.

By gamifying the software development experience, Developer Capitalist aims to be both entertaining for developers who will recognize the inside jokes and references, as well as accessible to anyone who enjoys idle/clicker games.
